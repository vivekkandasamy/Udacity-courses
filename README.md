# Project Explanation
Explanation of the different project submodules

## Project 1
For the __LRU_Cache__ problem, i used ordereddict since popitem() can be used to function as FIFO(First In First Out) with Ordereddict().

### Time and Space complexity
The time complexity of get() is O(1) Reason: No loops, constant time. The space complexity of get() is O(1) Reason: Only one variable is allocated

The time complexity of set() is O(1) Reason: No loops, constant time. The space complexity of set() is O(n) Reason: The dictionary is as large as the amount of keys
